        <img src="images/aboutme.jpg" alt="A Young Brian" width="300px"/>
        <p>I was born in Chicago, IL in 1994 and am the third of four children. I grew up in the South Side neighborhood of Beverly and have lived there for most of my life. After elementary school, I ventured out of the neighborhood and went to high school at St. Ignatius College Prep where I played lacrosse for four years. After high school, I went to the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. After my freshman year, I enrolled in the College of Media in pursuit of a degree in advertising. I had the opportunity to study abroad in the spring of 2015 and spent a semester in Spain and was able to travel to 14 countries in Europe. I graduated in 2016 with a degree in advertising and a business minor. I started my first job in July at a small advertising agency in downtown Chicago working as an Assistant Account Executive and moved out my parents house to Lakeview, where I currently live. In January, I was laid off because the agency was losing business, but I was able to find a new job by March at a different agency in River North and worked there until January of 2018. Now I am at Coding Temple ready to begin this new journey.</p>

        <p>Sports have been a part of my life for as long as I remember. Growing up I played any and all sports that I could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Soccer (K-4th)</li>
          <li>Basketball (4th-8th)</li>
          <li>Baseball (Pre-8th)</li>
          <li>Football (6th-8th)</li>
          <li>Volleyball(4th-8th)</li>
          <li>Lacrosse (9th-12th)</li>
          <li>Golf (7th-8th)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>When I’m not playing sports, I’m watching or reading about them. Growing up on the South Side, I am obviously a huge <a href="https://www.mlb.com/whitesox" target="_blank">White Sox</a> fan, as well as <a href="http://www.chicagobears.com" target="_blank">Bears</a>, <a href="http://www.nba.com/bulls/" target="_blank">Bulls</a>, and <a href="https://www.nhl.com/blackhawks/" target="_blank">Blackhawks</a>. I also follow the <a href="http://www.fightingillini.com" target="_blank">Illinois Fighting Illini</a> at the collegiate level. If you know anything about sports, you know that each of these are incredibly bad at the moment and are “rebuilding”, and hopefully 2019 my fandom is rewarded.</p>
        <p>Besides sports, I spend a lot of time binge-watching television shows. We are living in the “golden age of television” and I am here for it. Here is a short list of some of my favorite shows that I have watched in the past couple of years:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Game of Thrones</li>
          <li>Rick and Morty</li>
          <li>Peaky Blinders</li>
          <li>Black Mirror</li>
          <li>Altered Carbon</li>
          <li>Big Mouth</li>
          <li>Breaking Bad</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Why Coding?</h3>
        <img src="images/coding.jpg" alt="coding" width="300px"/>
        <p>After working in an advertising agency for almost a year, I realized I did not like what I was doing. I began thinking about what did interest me and what I wanted to do with my life going forward and two main past experiences came to mind. The first came in college. As a part of the curriculum for getting a business minor, I needed to take CS 105: Intro to Computing. From what I’d heard from friends who took it previously, it was a very difficult class. I went in expecting the worst, but I loved it. I found that the class challenged me, but I also felt a huge sense of accomplishment when I was able to figure out the problem and I ended up with an A in the class. The second experience came about a year after that during a summer internship. After the CS class, I told my boss that I was pretty proficient in Microsoft Excel. He gave me the task of creating a tool that the partners of the corporation would use to analyze data and make business decisions. During my 10 weeks there, I mostly worked on this tool and genuinely enjoyed going to work everyday to work on the project. When looking at these two experiences, it became obvious that this was the next step.</p>
